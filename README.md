# Wordle-fx

The puzzle game Wordle--minus the once-per-day restriction--recreated in JavaFX with a Model-View-Controller design. 

# Gameplay

The game works the same as the original Wordle, however the on-screen keyboard lacks an ENTER key and a BACKSPACE key 
so those must be used via physical keyboard. 

# Future Improvements
1. The project currently lacks validation for whether words the user inputs are real English words
2. The project does not have the same appearance as the real Wordle, only a similar one. Tweaks to this would help make this project feel more like the real wordle
3. The on-screen keyboard does not have an ENTER or BACKSPACE key
